# Rubik's Cube Simulation

Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Solver project! This is a personal project inspired by my love for puzzles and problem-solving. The goal is to create a fully functional Rubik's Cube simulator and solver that can be accessed online.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: A 3D representation of the Rubik's Cube with accurate colors.
- **Face Rotation**: Rotate any face of the cube intuitively using mouse or touch controls.
- **Undo Move**: Undo your last move to experiment with different solutions.
- **Cube Reset**: Reset the cube to its original solved state.
- **Scramble Cube**: Randomly scramble the cube to create a new puzzle to solve.
- **Custom Color Configuration**: Manually configure the cube's colors.
- **Configuration Validation**: Check if a custom cube configuration is solvable before attempting to solve it.

## Getting Started

The project is still in development, but the following instructions will help you get started:

### Prerequisites
- Having played with a Rubik's cube
- C# basics
- JavaScript Basics
- Three.js basics

### Running the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MichaelDjab/Rubik-Cube-Simulator-Solver.git

## Future Plans

- **Backend (C#)**: Handles the Rubik's Cube configuration validation, scrambling, and solving algorithms.
- **Multiple Solving Algorithms**: Choose from different solving methods.
- **Step-by-Step Solution Display**: View the solution steps to follow along with the solving process.
- **Solution Animation**: Watch the cube being solved through an animated sequence, with controls to move forward or backward through the steps.
- **Further Enhancements**: Additional features and improvements will be made over time, including new solving algorithms and UI enhancements.
