# Rubik's Cube Simulator & Solver

## Project Overview

The Rubik's Cube Simulator & Solver is a 3D simulation project built using Three.js, which allows you to explore and solve a Rubik's Cube in a browser environment. The project uses C# for the backend logic and JavaScript for the front end, with Three.js handling the 3D graphics.

**[Check out the live demo here](https://michaeldjabauri.github.io/Rubik-s-Cube-Three.js-Simulation/)**

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: A 3D representation of the Rubik's Cube with accurate colors.
- **Face Rotation**: Rotate any face of the cube using the w, y, r, o, g or b keys to move the white, yellow, red, orange, green or blue face respectively.
  
## Comming Soon
- **Rotation Improvements**: Rotate any face of the cube using buttons and mouse controls.
- **Undo Move**: Undo your last move to experiment with different solutions.
- **Cube Reset**: Reset the cube to its original solved state.
- **Scramble Cube**: Randomly scramble the cube to create a new puzzle to solve.
- **Custom Color Configuration**: Manually configure the cube's colors.
- **Configuration Validation**: Check if a custom cube configuration is solvable before attempting to solve it.
- **Solution**: Get a solution to the cube given any valid configuration.

## Getting Started

This project is still in development, but the following instructions will help you set up and run the Rubik's Cube Simulator & Solver.

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this project, you should have:
- Experience with solving or manipulating a Rubik's cube.
- Basic knowledge of C#.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
- Basic familiarity with Three.js.

### Running the Project

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MichaelDjab/Rubik-Cube-Simulator-Solver.git

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**:
   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   
3. **Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then install the required packages:**:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Run the development server: Start the local development server by running:**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

5. **Open the project in your browser: Once the server starts, Vite will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/Rubik-s-Cube-Three.js-Simulation/). Open that URL in your browser to view the project.**:

## Future Plans

- **Backend (C#)**: Handles the Rubik's Cube solving algorithms.
- **Step-by-Step Solution Display**: View the solution steps to follow along with the solving process.
- **Solution Animation**: Watch the cube being solved through an animated sequence, with controls to move forward or backward through the steps.
- **Further Enhancements**: Additional features and improvements will be made over time, including new solving algorithms and UI enhancements.
